# AI Augmented Life

The AI-Augmented Life is a project within the People+AI Research (PAIR) initiative to explore the ways in which Generative AI might affect our lives in coming years.

This repository contains code-fragments and proofs-of-concept that accompany the AI-Augmented Life blog (https://medium.com/people-ai-research) and provide a log of explorations made during this project.
