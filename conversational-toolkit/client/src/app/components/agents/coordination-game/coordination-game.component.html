<div style="margin: auto; max-width: 600px; padding: 6px">
  You are playing a two player coordination game. You and your partner must
  decide where to go out to dinner tonight.
  <b>You prefer Indian food</b>. Your partner prefers Thai food. But you both
  prefer to go to the same place rather than different places.<br /><br />

  Your payoff matrix is as follows:<br /><br />

  <ul>
    <li>
      If you both choose Thai food, you get <b>{{ p2_thai }}</b> points.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you both choose Indian food, you get <b>{{ p2_indian }}</b> points.
    </li>
    <li>If you choose a different place to eat, you both get 0 points.</li>
  </ul>
  Your partner has a different payoff matrix.<br /><br />
  <b>All points are out of 10 and have an equal distribution.<br /><br /></b>

  You must discuss options with them and then make a decision. Your goal is to
  maximize the TOTAL payoff. When you are ready to make a decision, say to the
  assistant: <b>"Ok, choose"</b><br /><br />

  Just for testing, the assistant will now reveal their decision. You'll need to
  just remember your decision and see if it correlates. Later, we might add some
  UI.<br /><br />

  Never reveal your payoff matrix to your partner, instead express your
  preferences in a way that helps you both maximize the total payoff.
